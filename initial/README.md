### Initial Project Structure and Documentation
This commit introduces the foundational documentation and initial architecture plans for the multi-persona AI system, forming the basis of the "Meta-AI Playbook." These documents define the core components, operational guidelines, and ethical framework for the system.

### Key Additions
#### Core System Definitions
*   `playbook.md`: The comprehensive Meta-AI Playbook, outlining all high-level aspects of the system.
*   `architecture_map.md`: Detailed overview of core components, service architecture, data models, and directory structure.
*   `high_level_workflows.md`: Visual and textual descriptions of general operational cycles.
*   `iteration_plan.md`: Initial plan for iterative refinement and future feature expansion.

#### Agent and Role Management
*   `extracted_roles.md`: Definitions and system prompts for all AI personas.
*   `refined_prompts.md`: Refined versions of the system prompts for clarity and effectiveness.
*   `dispatch_module_plan.md`: Plan for agent dispatch, turn-taking, and agent registration.

#### Communication and Protocols
*   `communication_rules.md`: Specifies inter-agent message envelope, standard channels, and interaction patterns.
*   `protocols.md`: Extracted and formalized communication protocols, including the Space Format.
*   `kicklang_schema.md`: Defines the KickLang schema for core entities (Task, Agent, Message, etc.).
*   `nl_kicklang_service_plan.md`: Plan for natural language to KickLang translation service.

#### Operational Processes and Monitoring
*   `extracted_tas.md` and `purified_tas.md`: Extracted and consolidated core operational tasks.
*   `task_state_module_plan.md`: Plan for task management and state tracking, including data structures and algorithms.
*   `monitoring_module_plan.md`: Plan for system monitoring, metrics, anomaly detection, and alerting.

#### Ethical Framework
*   `ethics.md`: Extracted ethical guidelines and principles for the system.
*   `ethics_integration_plan.md`: Plan for integrating ethical review and oversight into the operational cycle.
