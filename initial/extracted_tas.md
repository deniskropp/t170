# Extracted Core Operational Processes (TAS)

⫻task/TAS:playbook/001
Name: Task Identification & Prioritization
Description: Tasks are identified from the overall plan. The Orchestrator prioritizes tasks based on their dependencies and the overarching project goals. Dependencies must be resolved before a task can be considered for execution.

⫻task/TAS:playbook/002
Name: State Management & Tracking
Description: Each task is assigned a specific state: 'pending', 'in_progress', 'completed', or 'cancelled'. The Orchestrator is responsible for accurately updating these states to reflect real-time progress and maintain a clear overview of the project's status.

⫻task/TAS:playbook/003
Name: Turn-taking and Execution
Description: The Orchestrator assigns tasks to the appropriate personas (agents) based on their defined roles and facilitates their execution. This involves orchestrating the flow of control and information between different AI personas to achieve task objectives efficiently.

⫻task/TAS:playbook/004
Name: Dependency Enforcement
Description: Tasks are only initiated for execution once all their declared dependencies are marked as 'completed'. The Orchestrator strictly enforces this rule to ensure a logical and error-free progression through the playbook development process.

⫻task/TAS:playbook/005
Name: Escalation Protocols
Description: When a task requires external information, clarification, or a decision that falls outside the current operational scope or the capabilities of the involved personas, the Orchestrator will escalate the matter. Escalation involves pausing the task and seeking input from a higher authority or a more specialized persona/human intervention.

⫻task/TAS:playbook/006
Name: Continuous Monitoring
Description: The Orchestrator, in conjunction with the SystemMonitor persona, continuously monitors task progress, system performance, and identifies any bottlenecks, deviations, or issues that may arise. This proactive monitoring ensures the timely detection and resolution of potential problems.

⫻task/TAS:playbook/007
Name: Issue Identification & Reporting
Description: Any detected deviations from coherence or resilience standards will be documented. Potential issues will be flagged for the Orchestrator's review and potential escalation.

⫻task/TAS:playbook/008
Name: Translation Process
Description: 1. Identification of Key Concepts. 2. Mapping to Formal Elements. 3. Structure Derivation. 4. Validation.

⫻task/TAS:playbook/009
Name: Adaptation Process
Description: 1. Identification of Need. 2. Proposal for Change. 3. Review and Approval. 4. Role Definition Update. 5. Prompt Refinement. 6. Communication.

⫻task/TAS:playbook/010
Name: Decision-Making Process
Description: 1. Identify Decision Point. 2. Define Scope and Stakeholders. 3. Information Gathering. 4. Discussion and Deliberation. 5. Formulate Recommendation/Decision. 6. Documentation. 7. Communication.

⫻task/TAS:playbook/011
Name: Plan Generation Process
Description: 1. Input Gathering. 2. Objective Definition. 3. Task Breakdown. 4. Resource Allocation. 5. Timeline and Milestones. 6. Risk Assessment. 7. Review and Refinement.
